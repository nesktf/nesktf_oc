# OpenComputers programs
Just a bunch of scripts that I use in my worlds, usually in GTNH

## Programs
- `fluid-reactor`
    - GTNH fluid nuke controller. [README](fluid_nuke/README.md)
- `mpc`
    - Simple music player daemon client (WIP)
- `greg-chance`
    - Aproximates the chance of getting something from a machine (usually from greg machines)
